# Digit Span Test

This is a forward digit-span test useful for testing a subject's working memory.
Specifically, the subject will be presented with a sequence of digits (starting at 3 digits, each digit is presented separately), which have to be recalled in a forward-facing manner. For instance, if the sequence is [3,1,9], the subject needs to type in [3,1,9] to get the correct result. If the sequence entered is correct, the length of the next sequence presented will be increased by one digit. If it is incorrect, the subject may try again (up to 3 failures possible, after which the task will be terminated).
